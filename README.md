before running application, navigate to ./Front_End/Box-Factory-Front-End and run ng build.

after that you can run dotnet run from ./api

Also had those issues with pipline testing.

Attempted implementing login authentication. Was successful with the backend portion but ran out time and energy before hand in time for the front end.

Enjoy and happy holidays :)
